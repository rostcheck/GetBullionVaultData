This project provides facilities for accesing the BullionVault service through .NET classes. 
It contains an API proxy, implemented in BullionVaultProxy.dll, and a command-line program 
(GetBullionVaultData) that makes use of it. At present, the API only implements facilities
for login, getting price data, and getting a transaction list.

This software was developed by David Rostcheck (davidrostcheck@gmail.com) and is freely offered 
for use, including reuse or resale, under the terms of the attached MIT license.

BullionVault is a service name associated with Galmarley Limited in the UK; this package is 
independently developed to make use of their service's published API, but Galmarley Limited is 
not associated with this software and has no support responsibility for it.
